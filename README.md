Hi there, trap-representation here.

I'm a self-taught C programmer, who likes to write *strictly standard conforming code*. UB scares the heck out of me.

I'm currently working on a stack-based, assembly-like language, which you can find [here](https://github.com/trap-representation/Sasm). I also upload demos of it on my YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0j25PUywdrQGOR2jWkuPHg).

You can also check out [this animation I made](https://youtu.be/-gVAP8YMlk0) about UB I made recently.

If you want to contact me, you can shoot me a mail at programmertotherescue@gmail.com.
