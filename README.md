Hi there, trap-representation here.

I'm a self-taught C programmer, who likes to write *strictly standard conforming code*. UB scares the heck out of me.

I'm currently working on a stack-based language, which you can find [here](https://github.com/trap-representation/Chlore). I also upload demos of it on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0j25PUywdrQGOR2jWkuPHg).

And before you ask, vim and Emacs aren't really my cup of tea. I use [my own text editor](https://github.com/trap-representation/YET).

BTW, if you're one of those people who think it's fine to use erroneous constructs as long as it "works", check out [this animation I made about undefined behavior](https://youtu.be/-gVAP8YMlk0).

Want to contact me? You can shoot me a mail at programmertotherescue AT gmail.com.
